## WAI-ARIA attributes

The web accessibility makes web applications and its content more accessible to people with disabled without any barriers. Especially it tracks the dynamic value changes and DOM changes.

TimePicker component has covered the [WAI-ARIA](http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria-practices) specifications with the following list of WAI-ARIA attributes `aria-haspopup`, `aria-selected`, `aria-disabled`, `aria-activedescendant`,
`aria-expanded`, `aria-owns`, and `aria-autocomplete`.

Here, the `combobox` as a role for input element and `listbox` as a role for popup element in the TimePicker.

* **Aria-haspopup** : Indicates whether this element displays a pop-up window.

* **Aria-selected** : Indicates the currently selected time value.

* **Aria-disabled** : Indicates the disabled state of the TimePicker component.

* **Aria-expanded** : Indicates the expanded or collapsed state of the popup.

* **Aria-autocomplete** : Indicates whether user input completion suggestions are provided or not.

* **Aria-owns** : Attribute that creates a parent/child relationship between the two DOM element in accessibility layer

* **Aria-activedescendent** : Attribute that helps in managing the current active child of the TimePicker component.

* **Role** : Attributes that gives assistive technologies information for handling each element in a widget.
