# Column selection in React Grid component

Column selection can be done through simple mouse down or arrow keys.

You can enable column selection by setting the [`selectionSettings.allowColumnSelection`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/grid/selectionSettings/#allowcolumnselection) property as true.
