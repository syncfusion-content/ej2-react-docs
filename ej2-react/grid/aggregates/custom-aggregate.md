# Custom aggregate in React Grid component

To calculate the aggregate value with your own aggregate functions, use the custom aggregate option. To use custom aggregation, specify the [`type`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/grid/aggregateColumn/#type) as **Custom**, and provide the custom aggregate function in the [`customAggregate`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/grid/aggregateColumn/#customaggregate) property.

The custom aggregate function will be invoked with different arguments for total and group aggregations.
* **Total aggregation**: The custom aggregate function will be called with the whole data and current [`AggregateColumn`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/grid/aggregateColumn/) object.
* **Group aggregation**: This will be called with the current group details and [`AggregateColumn`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/api/grid/aggregateColumn/) object.
