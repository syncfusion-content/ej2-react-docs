# Getting Started with React Linear Gauge

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->

This section explains you the steps required to create a simple Linear Gauge and demonstrate the basic usage of the Linear Gauge control.

## Dependencies

Following is the list of minimum dependencies required to use the Linear Gauge.

```javascript
+-- @syncfusion/ej2-react-lineargauge
|-- @syncfusion/ej2-lineargauge
    |-- @syncfusion/ej2-base
    |-- @syncfusion/ej2-svg-base
    |-- @syncfusion/ej2-pdf-export
|-- @syncfusion/ej2-react-base
```

## Installation and configuration

To get started with the React application, [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) can be used to setup the application. To install **create-react-app** run the following command.

   ```
     npm install -g create-react-app
   ```

To create basic React application, run the following command.

    <div class='jsx'>

    ```
      create-react-app quickstart
    ```
   </div>

Now, the application is created in the **quickstart** folder. Run the following command one-by-one to navigate to the **quickstart** folder, and install the required **npm** packages.

     ```
     cd quickstart
     npm install
   ```

> In the **quickstart** application, the Syncfusion component is added in the JavaScript file.

### Creating a React application with TypeScript

To create React application with TypeScript, use the following command.

    <div class='jsx'>

    ```
    create-react-app quickstart --template typescript
   ```
   </div>

Now, the application is created in the **quickstart** folder. Run the following command one-by-one to navigate to the **quickstart** folder, and install the required **npm**  packages.

  ```
   cd quickstart
   npm install
  ```

### Adding Syncfusion packages

All the available Essential JS 2 packages are published in [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/~syncfusionorg) public registry. To install Linear Gauge package, use the following command.

```
npm install @syncfusion/ej2-react-lineargauge --save
```

### Adding Linear Gauge component to the Project

Now, the Linear Gauge component can be added in the application. To initialize the Linear Gauge control in the React application, import the Linear Gauge control in the **src/App.js** or **src/App.tsx** as per the application. Please use the below code to include the Linear Gauge component in the application.



```ts

import React from 'react';
import { LinearGaugeComponent } from '@syncfusion/ej2-react-lineargauge';

export function App() {
   return (<LinearGaugeComponent></LinearGaugeComponent>);
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('container'));
root.render(<App />);

```

### Run the application

The Linear Gauge control is now included in the **quickstart** application. Use the following command to run the application.

```
npm start
```

## Module Injection

Linear gauge component are segregated into individual feature-wise modules. In order to use a particular feature,
inject its feature service in the **AppModule**. Please find the feature service name and description as follows.

* `Annotations` - Inject this module in to `services` to use annotation feature.
* `GaugeTooltip` - Inject this module in to `services` to use tooltip feature.

These modules should be injected into the `services` section as follows,



 ```ts
 import * as React from "react";
 import * as ReactDOM from "react-dom";
 import { LinearGaugeComponent, Annotations, GaugeTooltip} from '@syncfusion/ ej2-react-lineargauge';

 export function App(){
    return(<LinearGaugeComponent>
                <Inject services={[Annotations, GaugeTooltip]}/>
            </LinearGaugeComponent>
    );
 }
  const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('container'));
  root.render(<App />);

 ```

## Adding the Linear Gauge Title

The title can be added to the Linear Gauge component using the [`title`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/linear-gauge/linearGaugeModel#title-string) property in the Linear Gauge.

{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/linear-gauge/getting-started-cs1/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/linear-gauge/getting-started-cs1/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

 {% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/linear-gauge/getting-started-cs1" %}

## Axis Range

The range of the axis can be set using the [`minimum`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/linear-gauge/axis#minimum-number) and [`maximum`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/linear-gauge/axis#maximum-number) properties in the Linear Gauge.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/linear-gauge/getting-started-cs2/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/linear-gauge/getting-started-cs2/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

 {% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/linear-gauge/getting-started-cs2" %}

To denote the axis values with temperature units, add the °C as suffix to each label. This can be achieved by setting the **{value}°C** to the [`format`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/linear-gauge/labelModel/#format-string) property in the [`labelStyle`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/linear-gauge/axis#labelstyle-labelmodel) object of the axis. Here, **{value}** acts as a placeholder for each axis label.

To change the pointer value from the default value of the gauge, set the [`value`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/linear-gauge/pointer/#value-number) property in [`pointers`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/linear-gauge/pointerModel/) object of the axis.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/linear-gauge/getting-started-cs3/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/linear-gauge/getting-started-cs3/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

 {% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/linear-gauge/getting-started-cs3" %}

## Setting the value of the pointer

The pointer value is changed in the below sample using the [`value`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/linear-gauge/pointer/#value-number) property in [`pointers`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/linear-gauge/pointer) object of the axis.
