# Filter list items in the listview in React Listview component

The filtered data can be displayed in the ListView component depending upon on user inputs using the
[`DataManager`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/data/getting-started/). Refer to the
following steps to render the ListView with filtered data.

* Render a textbox to get input for filtering data.

* Render ListView with
  [`dataSource`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/list-view/#datasource), and set
  the [`sortOrder`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/list-view/#sortorder) property.

* Bind the `keyup` event for textbox to perform filtering operation. To filter list data, pass the list data source to the
  `DataManager`, manipulate the data using the
  [`executeLocal`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/documentation/api/data/dataManager/#executelocal) method,
  and then update filtered data as ListView dataSource.

> In this demo, data has been filtered with starting character of the list items. You can also filter list items with ending
> character by passing the `endswith` in
