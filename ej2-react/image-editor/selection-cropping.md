# Selection cropping in React Image editor component

The Image Editor component has multiple selection options including custom, square, circle, and customized to various aspects ratios. The selection region can be dragged and resized for cropping an image. The selection can be made by either using a toolbar or the [`select`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/image-editor/#select) method.  

In the [`select`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/image-editor/#select) method, the selection type needs to be specified as a custom, square, circle, and aspect ratios such as 3:2, 4:3, 5:4, 7:5, 16:9.

In the toolbar, the selection can be made by clicking the crop dropdown button and picking the selection option such as custom, square, circle, and aspect ratios.

## Custom

The selection region can be customized by dragging and resizing an image.

In the toolbar, the custom selection can be done by clicking the crop dropdown button and picking the `Custom` option from that popup.

In the following example, the [`select`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/image-editor/#select) method is used in the button click to the custom selection.
