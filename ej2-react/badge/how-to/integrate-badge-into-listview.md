# Integrate badge into listview in React Badge component

The badges can be integrated with the `listview` component to indicate new notification with color based on priority.

In the following sample, `default` badges are used and there is no need to customize the badge size. The
component will automatically adjust the size based on the container element.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/badge/listview-cs1/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/badge/listview-cs1/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/badge/listview-cs1/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.css" %}
{% include code-snippet/badge/listview-cs1/index.css %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/badge/listview-cs1" %}
