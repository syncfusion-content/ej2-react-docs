# Accessibility in React Diagram Component

The Diagram component provides built-in compliance with the [WAI-ARIA](http://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria-practices/) specifications. WAI-ARIA accessibility support is achieved through attributes like `aria-label`, which provide information about elements in a document for assistive technologies such as screen readers.

The following table outlines accessibility compliance for the Diagram component:

| Accessibility Criteria                                                              | Compatibility                                                                        |
