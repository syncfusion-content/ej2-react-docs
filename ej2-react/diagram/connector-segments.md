# Connector Segments in React Diagram Component

Connector segments define the path and visual appearance of connectors between nodes or points in a diagram. The path of a connector is constructed using a collection of segments, where each segment represents a portion of the connector's route. Understanding and configuring these segments allows for precise control over connector appearance and routing behavior.

## Segment Types

The React Diagram component supports three primary types of connector segments, each serving different visual and functional requirements:

* Straight
* Orthogonal
* Bezier
