# Change the color of textbox in React Textbox Component

You can change the color of the TextBox by validating its value using regular expression in the `keyup` event for predicting the numeric values as demonstrated in the following code sample.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/textbox/textbox-color-change-cs1/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/textbox/textbox-color-change-cs1/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

 {% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/textbox/textbox-color-change-cs1" %}
