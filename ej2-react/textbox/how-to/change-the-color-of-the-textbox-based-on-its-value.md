# Change the color of the TextBox based on its value in React TextBox component

You can change the color of the TextBox by validating its value using regular expression in the `keyup` event for predicting the numeric values as demonstrated in the following code sample.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/textbox/textbox-color-change-cs1/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/textbox/textbox-color-change-cs1/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
