# Change the color of the TextBox based on its value in React TextBox component

Dynamically update the TextBox appearance based on user input by validating the value using regular expressions in the `keyup` event. This provides immediate visual feedback about input validity. The following example demonstrates changing the TextBox color when numeric values are detected.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/textbox/textbox-color-change-cs1/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/textbox/textbox-color-change-cs1/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
