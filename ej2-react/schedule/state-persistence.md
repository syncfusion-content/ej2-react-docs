# State persistence in React Schedule component

State persistence allowed Scheduler to retain the [`currentView`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule/#currentview), [`selectedDate`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule/#selecteddate) and Scroll position values in the [`localStorage`](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp#) for state maintenance even if the browser is refreshed or if you move to the next page within the browser. This action is handled through the [`enablePersistence`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/schedule/#enablepersistence) property which is set to false by default. When it is set to true, `currentView`, `selectedDate` and Scroll position values of the scheduler component will be retained even after refreshing the page.

> **Note**: Scheduler `id` is essential to set state persistence.

The following sample demonstrates how to set state persistence of the Scheduler component.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/schedule/local-data-cs26/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/schedule/local-data-cs26/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/schedule/local-data-cs26/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/schedule/local-data-cs26" %}
