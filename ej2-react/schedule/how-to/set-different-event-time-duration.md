# Set different event time duration in React Schedule component

In event window, start/end time duration will be processed based on the `interval` value within the `timeScale` property. By default, `interval` value is 30, therefore in event window start/end time duration will be in 30 mins duration. You can set custom interval range to the start/end time in event window using `popupOpen` event as shown below.
