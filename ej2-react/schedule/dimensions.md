# Dimensions in React Schedule component

The Scheduler dimensions refers to both height and width of the entire layout and it accepts 3 types of values.

* auto
* pixel
* percentage

## Auto Height and Width

When height and width of the Scheduler are set to `auto`, it will try as hard as possible to keep an element the same width as its parent container. In other words, the parent container that holds Scheduler, it's width/height will be the sum of its children. By default, Scheduler is assigned with `auto` values for both height and width properties.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/schedule/events-cs43/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/schedule/events-cs43/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/schedule/events-cs43/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/schedule/events-cs43" %}

## Height and Width in pixel

The Scheduler height and width will be rendered exactly as per the given pixel values. It accepts both string and number values.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/schedule/events-cs44/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/schedule/events-cs44/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/schedule/events-cs44/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/schedule/events-cs44" %}

## Height and Width in percentage

When height and width of the Scheduler are given as percentage, it will make the Scheduler as wide as the parent container.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/schedule/events-cs45/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/schedule/events-cs45/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/schedule/events-cs45/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/schedule/events-cs45" %}
