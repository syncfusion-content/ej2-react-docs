# Getting Started with Essential<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> UI Kit for React

Follow the steps below to start using the Essential<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> UI Kit for React. You can begin in one of two ways:

- **Download the app from GitHub:** Get the full source code and run the app locally to explore the blocks.
- **View the online demo:** Interact with the blocks directly through the online demo without downloading any files.

## Get started by downloading the app from GitHub

### Step 1: Download and open the app in Visual Studio Code

Download the app from the GitHub repository: https://github.com/syncfusion/essential-ui-kit-for-react, and open the project in Visual Studio Code to start working with it.

### Step 2: Open a new terminal

In Visual Studio Code, open the integrated terminal via **Terminal > New Terminal**.

### Step 3: Install dependencies and run the app

Run the following commands in the terminal:

1. **Install dependencies**  
   Install all required packages for the blocks, Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> React components, and the sample browser:

   ![Installing the required dependencies](images/installing-the-required-dependencies.png)

   This downloads and installs all dependencies listed in the project's **package.json** file.

2. **Serve the app locally**  
   After installing dependencies, start the React development server:

   The server will display a local host URL in the terminal, for example:

   ![Local development server running](images/local-development-server-running.png)

   To view the app, **Ctrl + Click** (Windows) or **Cmd + Click** (macOS) the localhost URL displayed in the terminal to open the app in the default browser.

### Step 4: License key requirement

The blocks include Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> React components that require an active license key for proper display and usage. Activate and register a license key as described below.

#### How to obtain the license key

Generate a license key from the Syncfusion account page: https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/licensing/license-key-generation.

#### How to register the license key in the app

Register the license key using one of the methods on the registration guide: https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/licensing/license-key-registration#register-syncfusion-license-key-using-the-npx-command.

Registering the license key ensures components function without licensing warnings.

## Get started by viewing the online demo

If you prefer a quick demo instead of downloading the app, explore the blocks directly via the online demo: https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/essential-ui-kit/blocks.
