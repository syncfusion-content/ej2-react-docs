# Animation in React Drop down button component

The [`animationSettings`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/drop-down-button/#animationsettings) property is used to customize the animation of the DropDownButton popup. The supported effects for DropDownButton are,

| Effect | Functionality |
| ------------ | ----------------------- |
| None | Specifies the Dropdown popup transform with no animation effect. |
| SlideDown | Specifies the Dropdown popup transform with slide down effect. |
| ZoomIn | Specifies the Dropdown popup transform with zoom in effect. |
| FadeIn | Specifies the Dropdown popup transform with fade in effect. |

In this sample, three different DropDownButtons are rendered, each showcasing a unique animation effect for the dropdown menu:

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="app.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/drop-down-button/animation-cs1/app/app.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/drop-down-button/animation-cs1/app/app.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
