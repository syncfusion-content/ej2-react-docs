Popup open position can be changed according to the requirement. Popup open position can be changed in [`open`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/drop-down-button/#open) event by setting `top` and `left` for the popup element.

In the following example, the `top` position of the popup element is changed in `open` event.
