# Customize icon and width in React Drop down button component

Width of the DropDownButton can be customized by setting required width to the dropdown element.

The following UI can be achieved by setting [`iconPosition`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/drop-down-button/#iconposition) as `Top`, width as `85px` and size of the font icon as `40px` by adding `e-custom` class.
