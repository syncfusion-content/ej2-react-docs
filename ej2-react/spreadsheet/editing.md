# Editing in React Spreadsheet component

You can edit the contents of a cell directly in the cell or by typing in the formula bar. By default, the editing feature is enabled in the spreadsheet. Use the [`allowEditing`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/spreadsheet/#allowediting) property to enable or disable the editing feature.

To get start quickly with Editing, you can check on this video:

## Edit cell

You can start editing by one of the following ways,

* Double click a cell to start the edit mode.
* Press `F2` key to edit the active cell.
* Use formula bar to perform editing.
* Use `BACKSPACE` or `SPACE` key to clear the cell content and start the edit mode.
* Using the [`startEdit`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/spreadsheet/#startedit) method.

## Save cell

If the cell is in editable state, you can save the edited cell by one of the following ways,

* Perform mouse click on any other cell rather than the current editing cell.
* Press `Enter` or `Tab` keys to save the edited cell content.
* Using the [`endEdit`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/spreadsheet/#endedit) method.

## Cancel editing

To cancel the editing without saving the changes, you can use one of the following ways,

* Press `ESCAPE` key, this will remove the editable state and update the unchanged cell content.
* Using the [`closeEdit`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/spreadsheet/#closeedit) method.

The following sample shows how to prevent the editing and cell save. Here `E` column prevent the editing by using cancel argument as true in [`cellEdit`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/spreadsheet/#celledit) event. In `D` column, prevent saving the edited changes by using cancel argument as true in [`beforeCellSave`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/spreadsheet/#beforecellsave) and use [`closeEdit`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/spreadsheet/#closeedit) method in spreadsheet.
