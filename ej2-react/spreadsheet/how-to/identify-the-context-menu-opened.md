## Identify the context menu opened in React Spreadsheet component

The Spreadsheet includes several context menus that will open and display depending on the action. When you right-click on a cell, for example, a context menu with options related to the cell element appears.

The class name returned by the [contextMenuBeforeOpen](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/spreadsheet/#contextmenubeforeopen) event can be used to identify the context menu that is opened. The context menus and their class names are tabulated below.

| Class name | Context menu name |
|-------|---------|
| .e-sheet-content | Cell context menu |
| .e-toolbar-item | Footer context menu |
| .e-rowhdr-table | Row header context menu |
| .e-colhdr-table | Column header context menu |

The following code example shows how to identify the context menu opened.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="app.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/find-target-context-menu/app/app.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/spreadsheet/find-target-context-menu/app/app.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/spreadsheet/find-target-context-menu" %}
