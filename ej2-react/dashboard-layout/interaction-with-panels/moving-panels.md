# Moving panels in React Dashboard layout component

Other than drag and drop, it is possible to move the panels in Dashboard Layout programmatically. This can be achieved using [movePanel](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/dashboard-layout/#movepanel) method. The method is invoked as follows,

      ```js
       movePanel(id, row, col)
      ```

Where,
* id - ID of the panel which needs to be moved.
* row - New row position for moving the panel.
* col - New column position for moving the panel.

Each time a panel's position is changed(Programmatically or through UI interaction), the Dashboard Layout's [change](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/dashboard-layout/#change) event will be triggered.

The following sample demonstrates moving a panel programmatically to a new position in the Dashboard Layout's [created](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/dashboard-layout/#created) event.
