# Floating of panels in React Dashboard layout component

The floating functionality of the component allows you to effectively use the entire layout for the panel's placement. If the floating functionality is enabled, the panels within the layout get floated upwards automatically to occupy the empty cells available in previous rows. This functionality can be enabled or disabled using the `allowFloating` property of the component.

The following sample demonstrates how to enable or disable the floating of panels in the Dashboard Layout component.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="app.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/dashboard-layout/floating-cs1/app/App.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/dashboard-layout/floating-cs1/app/App.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/dashboard-layout/floating-cs1/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/dashboard-layout/floating-cs1/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
