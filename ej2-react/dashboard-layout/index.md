# Index in React Dashboard layout component

The **Dashboard Layout** is a grid structured layout control that helps create a dashboard with panels. Panels hold the UI components and allow resize, reorder, drag-n-drop, remove and add options. This allows users to easily place the components at the desired position within the grid layout.

## Key features

1. **Drag and Drop**: Allows drag and drop of panels at the desired location within the dashboard.

2. **Resizing**: Support to resize the panels in any direction as per the requirement.

3. **Floating**: Floats the panels upward when the dragging option is enabled.

4. **Media Query**: Allows the panels to be stacked when the specified resolution is met.
