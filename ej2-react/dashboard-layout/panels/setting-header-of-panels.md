# Setting header of panels in React Dashboard layout component

The dashboard layout component is mostly used to represent the data used for monitoring or managing a process. These data or any HTML template can be placed as the content of a panel using the `content` property. Also, word or phrase that summarize the panelâ€™s content can be added as the header on the top of each panel using the `header` property of the panel.

The following sample demonstrates how to add content for each panel using the header and content properties of the panels.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="app.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/dashboard-layout/header-cs1/app/App.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/dashboard-layout/header-cs1/app/App.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/dashboard-layout/header-cs1/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/dashboard-layout/header-cs1/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

# Placing components as content of panels

In a dashboard, components like the chart, grids, maps, gauge, and more can be used to present a complex data. Such components can be placed as the panel content by assigning the corresponding component element as the `content` of the panel.

The following sample demonstrates how to add EJ2 Chart components as the `content` for each panel in the dashboard layout component.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="app.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/dashboard-layout/header-content-cs1/app/App.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/dashboard-layout/header-content-cs1/app/App.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/dashboard-layout/header-content-cs1/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/dashboard-layout/header-content-cs1/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

 {% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/dashboard-layout/header-content-cs1" %}
