# Set DatePicker as read-only in React Datepicker component

The DatePicker can be set to read-only mode using the [`readOnly`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/datepicker/#readonly) property. When enabled, users can view and select dates from the calendar popup, but cannot directly edit the input field. This is useful for scenarios where date selection should be guided through the calendar interface only.

The following example demonstrates how to configure a read-only DatePicker component:

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/datepicker/default-cs18/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/datepicker/default-cs18/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

 {% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/datepicker/default-cs18" %}
