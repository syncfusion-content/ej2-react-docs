# ColorPicker in DropDownButton in React Color picker component

This section explains how to render the ColorPicker in a DropDownButton. The [`target`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/drop-down-button/#target) property of the DropDownButton enables this scenario. To learn about the `target` property, refer to the [`Popup templating`](./../../drop-down-button/popup-items#popup-templating) section.

In the following sample, the ColorPicker is rendered as inline by setting the [`inline`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/color-picker/#inline) property to `true`, and the rendered ColorPicker wrapper is passed as a `target` to the DropDownButton.
