# Disabled in React Color picker component

To achieve disabled state in ColorPicker, set the [`disabled`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/color-picker/#disabled) property to `true`. The ColorPicker pop-up cannot be accessed in disabled state.

The following example shows the `disabled` state of ColorPicker component.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/colorpicker/how-to-cs2/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/colorpicker/how-to-cs2/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

 {% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/colorpicker/how-to-cs2" %}
