# Reverse in React Timeline component

You can display the Timeline items in reverse order, for different alignments by using the [reverse](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/timeline#reverse) property which provides adaptability and improves user interaction.

{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/timeline/reverse/app/index.tsx %}

{% endtabs %}
