# Customize progress bar in React Uploader component

Customize the progress bar appearance—including size, color, and background—by overriding the default Uploader component styles. The following example demonstrates how to apply custom CSS to match your application theme.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/uploader/progress-customize-cs1/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/uploader/progress-customize-cs1/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

 {% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/uploader/progress-customize-cs1" %}
