# Validate image on drop in React Uploader component

The uploader component allows you to upload all type of images by setting **image/* ** to [allowedExtensions](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/uploader/#allowedextensions) property.

By default, the behavior is working with select a file using browse button. But, this behavior doesnâ€™t support on drag and drop the files. You can handle this behavior manually using `selected` event by filtering the file types from application.

In the following example, validated image files using images/*. You are able to drag and drop the image files with extension of PNG, JPG, BPG, GIF and TIFF to upload it.

{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}

{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/uploader/validate-image-cs1/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
