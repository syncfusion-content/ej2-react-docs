# Add confirm dialog to remove the files in React Uploader component

You can customize the uploader component using confirm dialog before removing the files. Here, ej2 dialog is used as confirm dialog. Refer to the following example.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/uploader/confirm-dialog-cs1/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/uploader/confirm-dialog-cs1/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

 {% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/uploader/confirm-dialog-cs1" %}
