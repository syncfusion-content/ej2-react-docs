# Achieve invisible upload in React Uploader component

Invisible upload automatically initiates file upload immediately after file selection, without requiring a separate upload action. Enable this behavior by handling the selected event in the Uploader component. Refer to the following example.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/uploader/invisible-cs1/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/uploader/invisible-cs1/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

 {% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/uploader/invisible-cs1" %}
