# Check the MIME type of file before uploading it in React Uploader component

Validate file types before upload by checking the MIME type using the [uploading](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/uploader/#uploading) event. The following sample demonstrates displaying the file MIME type in an alert box before the upload begins.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/uploader/mime-type-cs1/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/uploader/mime-type-cs1/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

 {% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/uploader/mime-type-cs1" %}
