# Check the mime type of file before upload it in React Uploader component

By using the [uploading](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/uploader/#uploading) event, you can get the file MIME type before uploading it to the server.
In the following sample, file MIME type is shown in the alert box before the file starts to upload.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/uploader/mime-type-cs1/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/uploader/mime-type-cs1/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

 {% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/uploader/mime-type-cs1" %}
