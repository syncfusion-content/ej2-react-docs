# Preview images before uploading in React Uploader component

Display image previews before upload to allow users to verify their selection, or after successful server upload for confirmation. Create previews by reading file data using the selected event (client-side preview) or the success event (post-upload preview). This improves user experience by providing visual feedback during the upload workflow.

Refer to the following link to explore a complete image preview implementation:
