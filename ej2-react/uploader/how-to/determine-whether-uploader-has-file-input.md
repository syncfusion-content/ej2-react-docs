# Determine whether uploader has file input in React Uploader component

By setting the **required** attribute to uploader input element, you can validate the input file that has any value in it. In the following sample, set required attribute to the uploader input element and showcase the validation failure message using the `data-required-message` attribute.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/uploader/required-cs1/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/uploader/required-cs1/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

 {% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/uploader/required-cs1" %}
