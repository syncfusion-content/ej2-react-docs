# Validate file input requirement in React Uploader component

Enforce file selection requirement by applying the **required** attribute to the Uploader input element. This validates that at least one file must be selected before form submission. In the following sample, the required attribute is applied to the Uploader input element and a validation message is displayed using the `data-required-message` attribute.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/uploader/required-cs1/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/uploader/required-cs1/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

 {% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/uploader/required-cs1" %}
