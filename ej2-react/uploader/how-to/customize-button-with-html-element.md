# Customize button with HTML element in React Uploader component

Customize the Uploader action buttons (Browse, Upload, Clear) with custom HTML content using the [buttons](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/uploader/#buttons) property. This enables you to create branded or themed button styles that match your application design. Refer to the following example.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/uploader/buttons-cs1/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/uploader/buttons-cs1/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

 {% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/uploader/buttons-cs1" %}
