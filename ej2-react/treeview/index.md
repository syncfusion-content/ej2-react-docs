# Index in React Treeview component

The **TreeView** component is used to represent hierarchical data in a tree like structure with advanced functions to edit, drag and drop, select with CheckBox and more. TreeView can be populated from a data source such as an array of JavaScript objects or from DataManager.

## Key features

* **[Data Binding](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/treeview/data-binding)**: Binds the TreeView component with an array of JavaScript objects or `DataManager`.

* **[CheckBox](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/treeview/check-box)**: Allows you to select more than one node in TreeView without affecting the UI appearance.

* **[Drag and Drop](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/treeview/drag-and-drop)**: Allows you to drag and drop any node in TreeView.

* **[Multi Selection](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/treeview/multiple-selection)**: Allows you to select more than one node in TreeView.

* **[Sorting](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/treeview/ej1-api-migration#common)**: Allows display of the TreeView nodes in an `ascending`
or a `descending` order.
