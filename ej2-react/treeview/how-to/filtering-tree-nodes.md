# Filtering tree nodes in React Treeview Component

You can filter the tree nodes based on their text using the  `DataManager` plugin and the `fields` property of the TreeView.

The following code example demonstrates how to filter the tree nodes in a TreeView.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/tree-view/filtering-cs1/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/tree-view/filtering-cs1/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

 {% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/tree-view/filtering-cs1" %}
