# Sorting treeview level wise in React Treeview component

You can sort the TreeView nodes based on their level. When using the `sortOrder` property, the whole TreeView is sorted. When you sort a particular level, you can use the following code sample. The following code sample demonstrates how to sort the parent node alone in TreeView.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/tree-view/sort-tree-cs1/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/tree-view/sort-tree-cs1/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

 {% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/tree-view/sort-tree-cs1" %}
