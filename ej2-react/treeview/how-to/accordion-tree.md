# Accordion tree in React TreeView component

Accordion is an interface where a list of items can be collapsed or expanded, but only one list can be collapsed or expanded at a time. You can customize the TreeView to make it behave as an Accordion. Refer to the following code sample to create an Accordion tree.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/tree-view/accordion-tree-cs1/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/tree-view/accordion-tree-cs1/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
