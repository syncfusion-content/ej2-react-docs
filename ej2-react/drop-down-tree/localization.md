# Localization in React Drop down tree component

The [`Localization`](../../base/localization.html) library allows you to localize default text content of the Dropdown Tree and it can be localized to any culture by defining the texts and messages of the Dropdown Tree in the corresponding culture. The default locale of the Dropdown Tree is `en` (English). The following table represents the default texts and messages of the Dropdown Tree in `en` culture.

|KEY|Text/Message|
|----|----|
|noRecordsTemplate|No records found|
|actionFailureTemplate|Request failed|
|overflowCountTemplate|+${count} more..|
|totalCountTemplate|${count} selected|
