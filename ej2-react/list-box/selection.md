# Selection in React List box component

The ListBox provides support to select an item or a group of item by mouse or keyboard action. There are two selection modes available in list box,

* Single -  To select single item in the list box.
* Multiple -  To select multiple items in the list box.

On selection of each list box item, [`change`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/list-box/#change) event is triggered.

## Single selection

To enable single selection in the list box, [`mode`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/list-box/selectionSettingsModel/#mode) should be set as `single` in [`selectionSettings`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/list-box/#selectionsettings) property.
