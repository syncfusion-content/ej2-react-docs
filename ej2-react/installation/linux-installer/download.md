### Start Trial for NPM/NuGet Users

If components were installed via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=syncfusion%20ej2) or [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=syncfusion), start an evaluation to obtain the license key required for using trial packages in applications.

1. Start the 30-day free trial from the [Start Trial](https://www.syncfusion.com/account/manage-trials/start-trials) page in the account.

   > A license key for active trial products can be generated on the [Trials & Downloads](https://www.syncfusion.com/account/manage-trials/downloads) page. This license key is required when using trial packages in applications. Refer to the [Licensing overview](https://help.syncfusion.com/common/essential-studio/licensing/overview) for details.

   > If an active trial for the same product already exists and has not expired, it cannot be restarted.

3. After starting the trial, download the latest installer from the [Trials & Downloads](https://www.syncfusion.com/account/manage-trials/downloads) page. Older installers may require an unlock key; generate the unlock key (if applicable) or the license key from the same page.
