# React hooks accordion in React Accordion component

You can prevent the React JSX component reload issue on state changes by rendering the React JSX component as children of Accordion component. In the below example, we have prevented the re-rending of textbox component on state changes in Accordion component.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/accordion/react-hooks-cs1/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/accordion/react-hooks-cs1/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

 {% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/accordion/react-hooks-cs1" %}
