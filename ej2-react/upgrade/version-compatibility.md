## Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> version information

Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> follows a quarterly release schedule, introducing new volumes every three months. To track these releases and their associated changes, Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> React components utilize a sequence-based identifier system, employing the format **Major.Minor.Revision**. This system enables developers to easily monitor modifications made in each release.

For example, if the release package version is `22.1.34`, the version number can be interpreted as follows:

* **22** represents the `major release` version. This number changes every three months and encompasses significant updates, new features, as well as bug fixes and breaking changes.

* **1** corresponds to the `minor release` version. This number signifies releases primarily focused on new features and addressing bugs, without introducing breaking changes.

* **34** denotes the `revision number`, also referred to as the `patch number`. This number increases for weekly patch releases, which predominantly consist of bug fixes and do not introduce new features or breaking changes.
