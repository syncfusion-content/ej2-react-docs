# Draw in React Signature component

## Draw

The [`draw`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/signature/#draw) method draws text as a signature with customizable font families (Arial, Serif, etc.) and sizes. It accepts text, font family, and font size as parameters. Default values are "Arial" for font family and "30" for font size.
