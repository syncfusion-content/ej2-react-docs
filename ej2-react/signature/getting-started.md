## Dependencies

The following list of dependencies are required to use the Signature component in your application.

```javascript
|-- @syncfusion/ej2-react-base
```

## Setup your development environment

You can use [`Create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to setup the applications.

To install `create-react-app` run the following command.

   ```bash
    npm install -g create-react-app
   ```

Start a new project using create-react-app command as follows

    <div class='tsx'>

    ```
      create-react-app quickstart --scripts-version=react-scripts-ts
      cd quickstart
    ```

   </div>

   <div class='jsx'>

    ```
    create-react-app quickstart
    cd quickstart
   ```

   </div>

> 'react-scripts-ts' is used for creating React app with typescript.

## Adding Syncfusion packages

All the available Essential JS 2 packages are published in [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/~syncfusionorg) public registry.
You can choose the component that you want to install. For this application, we are going to use Signature component.

To install Signature component, use the following command

   ```bash
     npm install @syncfusion/ej2-react-inputs â€“save
   ```

The above command installs [Signature dependencies](./getting-started#dependencies) which are required to render the component in the `React` environment.

## Adding Style sheet to the Application

Add Signature component's styles as given below in `App.css`.

```css
@import "../node_modules/@syncfusion/ej2-base/styles/material.css";
@import "../node_modules/@syncfusion/ej2-inputs/styles/material.css";
```

## Add Signature to the project

Now, you can create `Signature` component in the application. Add `Signature` component in `src/App.tsx` file using the following code snippet.



```ts
import { SignatureComponent } from '@syncfusion/ej2-react-inputs';
import * as React from 'react';
function App() {
    return (<SignatureComponent id='signature'></SignatureComponent>);
}
export default App;
```

```ts
import { SignatureComponent } from '@syncfusion/ej2-react-inputs';
import * as React from 'react';
function App() {
    return (<SignatureComponent id='signature'></SignatureComponent>);
}
export default App;
```

## Run the application

Use the `npm run start` command to run the application in the browser.

   ```
   npm run start
   ```

The following example shows the default Signature.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/signature/getting-started-cs2/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/signature/getting-started-cs2/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
