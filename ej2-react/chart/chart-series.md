# Chart series in React Chart component

## Multiple Series

You can add multiple series to the chart by using [`series`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/chart/seriesModel/) property. The series are rendered in the order as it is added to the series array.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/chart/axis/category-cs12/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/chart/axis/category-cs12/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

 {% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/chart/axis/category-cs12" %}

## Combination Series

Combination of different types like Line, column etc, can be rendered in a chart.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/chart/series/combination-cs1/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/chart/series/combination-cs1/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

 {% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/chart/series/combination-cs1" %}

>Note: Bar series cannot be combined with any other series as the axis orientation is different from other series.
