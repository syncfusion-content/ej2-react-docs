The Query Builder provides the functionality to reposition rules or groups within the component effortlessly. This enhancement provides a more intuitive and flexible way to construct and modify queries. You can use [`allowDragAndDrop`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/query-builder/#allowDragAndDrop) to perform drag and drop functionality. And we have events support for drag and drop features that, indicates the [`dragStart`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/query-builder/#dragStart), [`drag`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/query-builder/#drag) and [`drop`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/query-builder/#drop) actions.
