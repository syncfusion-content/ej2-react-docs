# Accessibility in React Bullet chart component

Accessibility is achieved in the bullet chart control through WAI-ARIA standard. The bullet chart features can be effectively accessed through assistive technologies such as screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA

WAI-ARIA (Accessibility Initiative â€“ Accessible Rich Internet Applications) defines a way to increase the accessibility of web pages, dynamic content, and user interface components developed with AJAX, HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies. ARIA provides additional semantics to describe the role, state, and functionality of web components.

The following ARIA attributes are used in the bullet chart:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->
<table>
<tr>
<td><b>Element</b></td>
<td><b>Default description</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Title</td>
<td>Reads the bullet chart's title</td>
<tr>
<td>Legend</td>
<td>Reads the range name</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>FeatureMeasure Bar</td>
<td>Reads the target width and value height</td>
</tr>
</table>
