# Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> AI Coding Assistant Overview

The **Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> AI Coding Assistant** is designed to streamline the development workflow for React applications that use Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> components. It leverages contextual knowledge of the Syncfusion component library to generate code snippets, configuration examples, and guided explanations—reducing documentation lookups and increasing productivity.

AI Coding Assistant offerings:

* **SyncfusionReactAssistant MCP Server** — processes advanced prompts and returns tailored code suggestions via [MCP-compatible clients](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients).

## Getting started

To use the AI Coding Assistant, you need:

* A [Syncfusion user account](https://www.syncfusion.com/account)  
* An active Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> license (one of):  
  - [Commercial License](https://www.syncfusion.com/sales/unlimitedlicense)  
  - [Free Community License](https://www.syncfusion.com/products/communitylicense)  
  - [Free Trial](https://www.syncfusion.com/account/manage-trials/start-trials)  
* An active [API key](https://syncfusion.com/account/api-key)  
* A React application that includes SyncfusionReact (see [Quick Start](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/getting-started/quick-start))

## Unlimited access

Syncfusion provides unlimited access to the AI Coding Assistant with no restrictions on:

* Number of requests  
* Component usage  
* Query caps
* Usage duration

This ensures users can fully leverage Syncfusion components without usage constraints.

## Best practices

* Initial setup: Use the assistant to add and configure Syncfusion components quickly.  
* Feature tuning: Request prompt-based configuration to enable or disable component features.  
* Data binding: Generate sample data for testing and prototyping; avoid using sensitive production data.  
* Step-by-step explanations: Request annotated code to understand component behavior. Verify generated code for correctness.  
* Troubleshooting: Use AI suggestions for common issues; consult official [documentation](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation) or [support](https://support.syncfusion.com/support/tickets/create) for complex problems.

> Always review AI-generated code and content for accuracy before using in production.

## Recommendations

* Session management: Start a new session when switching tasks to keep context focused.  
* Model compatibility: For best results, use advanced AI models supported by your client.

## Privacy & data handling

The Syncfusion AI Coding Assistant is designed with privacy considerations:

* The tools do not access project files or workspace contents directly.  
* User prompts are not stored or used for other purposes.  
* Prompts are not used to train Syncfusion models.  
* The assistant provides context; the final output is produced by the selected AI model.
