# SyncfusionReact GitHub Copilot Extension

## Overview

The [SyncfusionReact GitHub Copilot Extension](https://github.com/apps/syncfusionreact) provides intelligent assistance for developers using Syncfusion's React component libraries. This extension integrates with GitHub Copilot to enhance development workflows by surfacing Syncfusion-specific guidance and examples directly in the Copilot chat.

### What is a GitHub Copilot Extension?

A GitHub Copilot extension extends Copilot's capabilities by integrating third-party tools and knowledge into the chat interface. It allows Copilot to access vendor documentation, APIs, and examples to provide more accurate, context-aware assistance tailored to a developer's technology stack.

### Key benefits

* Smart code suggestions for Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> React components  
* Best-practice guidance for component usage and configuration  
* Context-aware troubleshooting for complex scenarios

## Prerequisites

Before using this extension, ensure you have:

* [Github copilot](https://github.com/copilot/)
* An active Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> license (any of the following):
  - [Commercial License](https://www.syncfusion.com/sales/unlimitedlicense)
  - [Free Community License](https://www.syncfusion.com/products/communitylicense)
  - [Free Trial](https://www.syncfusion.com/account/manage-trials/start-trials)
* An active [API KEY](https://syncfusion.com/account/api-key)

## Unlimited access

Syncfusion provides unrestricted access to this Copilot extension—there are no limits on:

* Number of requests  
* Component usage  
* Query types  
* Usage duration

This allows developers to fully leverage Syncfusion components without usage constraints.

## Installation

1. Visit the [SyncfusionReact GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/syncfusionreact) and click **Install**.  
2. Grant the required read-access permissions to enable the extension to function with Copilot chat.  
3. Click **Install & Authorize**.  
4. Sign in with your Syncfusion account to authenticate and link the extension to your GitHub account. The API key is retrieved upon successful authentication.  
5. Restart your development environment (for example, VS Code) and start a new Copilot chat session to use the extension.

## Getting started

* Open the Copilot chat in a supported environment (GitHub Copilot or VS Code Copilot).  
* Type `@` in the chat prompt and select `SyncfusionReact` from the list of extensions.  
* Enter a query related to Syncfusion React components (configuration, implementation, or troubleshooting).

### Mode availability in VS Code

The Syncfusion Copilot extension supports all AI interaction modes—Ask, Edit, and Agent—when used in VS Code.

### Best practices for effective usage

1. Be specific: mention platform and component (e.g., "Create a Syncfusion React Grid with paging and filtering").  
2. Provide context: include project constraints, versions, and intended behavior.  
3. Use descriptive queries: avoid vague or overly broad questions.  
4. Start a fresh chat for a new topic or component to keep context focused.

## Example queries

* `@SyncfusionReact Create a Syncfusion data grid with paging and sorting`  
* `@SyncfusionReact How do I implement a responsive Syncfusion chart with tooltips?`  
* `@SyncfusionReact Show me a Syncfusion Kanban board implementation with drag and drop`

## Uninstallation

To remove the extension:

1. Go to [GitHub App Installations](https://github.com/settings/installations/).  
2. Locate the `SyncfusionReact` extension.  
3. Click **Configure**, then **Uninstall**.
