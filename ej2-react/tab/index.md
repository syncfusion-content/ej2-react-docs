# Index in React Tab component

The [React Tab](https://www.syncfusion.com/react-ui-components/react-tabs) is a content panel to show multiple contents in a specific space, one at a time.

## Key features

1. **[Rendering](../tab/getting-started):** Can be rendered based on the items collection and HTML elements.
2. **[Adaptive](../tab/adaptive):** Supports responsive rendering with scrollable Tabs and popup menu.
3. **[Customization](../tab/header):** Provides customization support for header with icons and orientation.
4. **[Animation](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/tab#animation):** Supports animation effects for moving previous/next contents of Tab.
5. **[Accessibility](../tab/accessibility):** Provides built-in compliance with the WAI-ARIA specifications and it is achieved through attributes. By default, it allows to interact with Tab headers by using keyboard shortcuts.
