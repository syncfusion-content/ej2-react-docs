# Getting Started with React Tab Component

This section explains how to create a simple **Tab** component and configure the Tab header content in a React application.

To get started quickly with React Tabs using Create React App, you can check out this video:

{% youtube "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1yvVlO-RN8" %}

## Prerequisites

[System requirements for Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> React UI components](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/system-requirement)

## Set up the Vite project

To create a new `Vite` project, use one of the commands that are specific to either NPM or Yarn.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight bash tabtitle="npm" %}
npm create vite@latest my-project -- --template react
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight bash tabtitle="yarn" %}
yarn create vite my-project --template react
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

After running the command, you will be prompted with a series of interactive questions to configure your project. Select the appropriate options for each prompt:

1. **Select a linter to use**: Choose the linter for your project (for example, `ESLint`).
2. **Install with npm and start now?**: Type `Yes` to proceed with installing the dependencies and automatically start the development server, or `No` to install dependencies manually later.

Navigate into the project directory with:

```
cd my-project
```

## Add Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> React packages

Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> React component packages are available at [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=ej2-react). To use Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> React components in the project, install the corresponding npm package.

To install the React component package, use the following command:

{% tabs %}
{% highlight bash tabtitle="npm" %}

npm install @syncfusion/ej2-react-navigations

{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight bash tabtitle="yarn" %}

yarn add @syncfusion/ej2-react-navigations

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
 
## Import Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> CSS styles

Themes for Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> React components can be applied using CSS or SASS files from the [npm theme packages](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/appearance/theme#theme-packages), CDN, CRG, or [Theme Studio](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/appearance/theme-studio). For more information, see the [themes documentation](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/appearance/theme).

This guide uses the `Tailwind 3` theme as an example, sourced from the theme package. In this package, each component includes an `index.css` file that automatically loads all the required dependency styles. To install the [Tailwind 3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@syncfusion/ej2-tailwind3-theme) theme package, use the following command:

{% tabs %}
{% highlight bash tabtitle="npm" %}

npm install @syncfusion/ej2-tailwind3-theme

{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight bash tabtitle="yarn" %}

yarn add @syncfusion/ej2-tailwind3-theme

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

By default, Vite projects include a `src/index.css` file with default styles. These default styles may conflict with Syncfusion component styles. Clear all content from the `src/index.css` file to prevent style conflicts.

The required styles for the Tab component are imported in the **src/App.css** file:

{% tabs %}
{% highlight css tabtitle="App.css" %}

@import "@syncfusion/ej2-tailwind3-theme/styles/tab/index.css";

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

> You can also refer to the combined CSS file for all Syncfusion components in your application. For more information, see the documentation on [referring themes through npm packages](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/appearance/theme#refer-themes-through-npm-packages).

## Add the Tab component

Now, you can add the React Tab component to your **src/App.jsx** file by importing and defining it within your application.Use the following code:

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="App.jsx" %}

import { TabComponent, TabItemDirective, TabItemsDirective } from '@syncfusion/ej2-react-navigations';
import * as React from 'react';
import * as ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './App.css';

function App() {

    let headerText = [{ text: "Twitter" }, { text: "Facebook" }, { text: "WhatsApp" }];
    const content0 = () => {
        return <div>
      Twitter is an online social networking service that enables users to send and read short 140-character messages called "tweets". Registered users can read and post tweets, but those who are unregistered can only read them. Users access Twitter through the website interface, SMS or mobile device app Twitter Inc. is based in San Francisco and has more than 25 offices around the world. Twitter was created in March 2006 by Jack Dorsey, Evan Williams, Biz Stone, and Noah Glass and launched in July 2006. The service rapidly gained worldwide popularity, with more than 100 million users posting 340 million tweets a day in 2012.The service also handled 1.6 billion search queries per day.
    </div>;
    }
    const content1 = () => {
        return <div>
      Facebook is an online social networking service headquartered in Menlo Park, California. Its website was launched on February 4, 2004, by Mark Zuckerberg with his Harvard College roommates and fellow students Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes.The founders had initially limited the website membership to Harvard students, but later expanded it to colleges in the Boston area, the Ivy League, and Stanford University. It gradually added support for students at various other universities and later to high-school students.
    </div>;
    }
    const content2 = () => {
        return <div>
      WhatsApp Messenger is a proprietary cross-platform instant messaging client for smartphones that operates under a subscription business model. It uses the Internet to send text messages, images, video, user location and audio media messages to other users using standard cellular mobile numbers. As of February 2016, WhatsApp had a user base of up to one billion,[10] making it the most globally popular messaging application. WhatsApp Inc., based in Mountain View, California, was acquired by Facebook Inc. on February 19, 2014, for approximately US$19.3 billion.
    </div>;
    }
    
    return (<TabComponent heightAdjustMode='Auto'>
      <TabItemsDirective>
        <TabItemDirective header={headerText[0]} content={content0}/>
        <TabItemDirective header={headerText[1]} content={content1}/>
        <TabItemDirective header={headerText[2]} content={content2}/>
      </TabItemsDirective>
    </TabComponent>);
}
export default App;

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

> In the above sample code, `element` is the `id` of the HTML element in a page to which the Tab is initialized.

## Run the application

Run the `npm run dev` command in the terminal to start the development server. This command compiles your code and serves the application locally, opening it in the browser.

```bash
npm run dev
```

The output will appear as follows:

{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/tab/tab-cs1" %}
