# Index in React Drop down list component

The DropDownList component contains a list of predefined values from which a single value can be chosen. When an arrow icon accompanied with this component is pressed, the dropdown displays a list of values from which you can select one.

## Key features

* **[Data binding](../drop-down-list/data-binding)** - Bind data from local or server-side data sources and access the list of items.

* **[Grouping](../drop-down-list/grouping)** - Group logically related items under a single or specific category.

* **[Sorting](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/drop-down-list/#sortorder)** - Sort list items in alphabetical order (ascending or descending).

* **[Filtering](../drop-down-list/filtering)** - Filter list items based on characters typed into the search box.

* **[Templates](../drop-down-list/templates)** - Customize list items, selected value, header, footer, category group header, and no records content.

* **[Accessibility](../drop-down-list/accessibility)** - Built-in accessibility support enables access to all DropDownList component features through keyboard, screen readers, and assistive technology devices.
