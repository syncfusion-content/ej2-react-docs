# Index in React Drop down list component

The DropDownList component contains a list of predefined values from which a single value can be chosen. When an arrow icon accompanied with this component is pressed, the dropdown displays a list of values from which you can select one.

## Key features

* **[Data binding](../drop-down-list/data-binding)** - Allows binding and accessing the list of items from local or server-side data source.

* **[Grouping](../drop-down-list/grouping)** -  Supports grouping of logically related items under a single or specific category.

* **[Sorting](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/drop-down-list/#sortorder)** - Supports sorting of list items in an alphabetical order (either ascending or descending).

* **[Filtering](../drop-down-list/filtering)** - Allows filtering of list items based on a character typed into the search box.

* **[Templates](../drop-down-list/templates)** - Allows customizing the list items, selected value, header, footer, category group header, and no records content.

* **[Accessibility](../drop-down-list/accessibility)** - Provided with built-in accessibility support that helps to access all the DropDownList component features through the keyboard, screen readers, or other assistive technology devices.
