# Virtual scroll in React Gantt component

Virtual Scroll support in Gantt allows you to load large amount of data without performance degradation. To enable Virtual Scrolling, you need to inject `VirtualScroll` module in Gantt.

## Row Virtualization

Row virtualization allows you to load and render a large number of tasks in Gantt with effective performance. In this mode, all tasks are fetched initially from the datasource and rendered in the DOM within a compact viewport area.

The number of records displayed in the Gantt is determined by the height.

This mode can be enable by setting the `enableVirtualization` property to `true`.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="index.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/gantt/virtualscroll-cs1/app/index.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="index.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/gantt/virtualscroll-cs1/app/index.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="index.html" %}
{% include code-snippet/gantt/virtualscroll-cs1/index.html %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/gantt/virtualscroll-cs1" %}

## Limitations for Virtual Scroll

* Due to the element height limitation in browsers, the maximum number of records loaded is limited by the browser capacity.
* Cell selection will not be persisted.
* The number of records rendered will be determined by the `height` property.
* It is necessary to mention the height of the Gantt in pixels when enabling Virtual Scrolling.
* Virtual Scroll does not support Multi Taskbar support in Resource View.
