# Splitting and merging tasks in React Gantt component

## Splitting task at load time

To split task at load time, we can define segment details in both hierarchical and self-referential way.
Refer below link for more details.

* [Split task at load time](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/gantt/data-binding#split-task)

## Split task dynamically

The task can be split dynamically, either by using the context menu or dialog.

* `Dialog`: `Segments` tab is rendered in add/edit dialog, when the [`taskFields.segments`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/gantt/taskFields/#segments) or [`taskFields.segmentId`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/gantt/taskFields/#segmentId) property is mapped. Using this tab, we can split the task based on the original start and end date of a particular task.

* `Context menu`: When the [`taskFields.segments`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/gantt/taskFields/#segments) or [`taskFields.segmentId`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/gantt/taskFields/#segmentId) property is mapped and the [`enableContextMenu`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/gantt/#enablecontextmenu) property is enabled, `Split Task` item will be included in the context menu.

## Merge tasks

The split tasks can be merged either by using the `Merge Task` item of the Context menu or by using the dialog. We can also merge the tasks, by simply dragging the segments together in the UI.

## Limitations of Split tasks

1. Parent and milestone tasks cannot be split into segments.
2. The task must have a width greater than the timeline unit cell in order to be split.
3. Split task is not supported in the `Resource view`.
