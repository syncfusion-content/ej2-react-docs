# Drag and drop from another in React Gantt component

In Gantt, it is possible to drag a record from another component and drop it in Gantt chart with updating the Gantt record. Here, dragging an item from `TreeView` component to Gantt and that item is updated as a resource for the Gantt record, we can achieve this, by using [`nodeDragStop`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/treeview/#nodedragstop) event of `TreeView` control.
