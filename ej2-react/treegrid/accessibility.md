## WAI-ARIA

WAI-ARIA (Accessibility Initiative â€“ Accessible Rich Internet Applications) defines a way to increase the accessibility of web pages, dynamic content, and user interface components developed with Ajax, HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies. ARIA provides additional semantics to describe the role, state, and functionality of web components.

The following ARIA attributes are used in the TreeGrid:
* grid (role)
* row (role)
* gridcell (role)
* aria-selected (attribute)
* aria-expanded (attribute)
* aria-sort (attribute)
* aria-busy (attribute)
* aria-invalid (attribute)
* aria-grabbed (attribute)
* aria-owns (attribute)
* aria-label (attribute)

## Keyboard navigation

TreeGrid functionalities can be interactive with keyboard shortcuts.

## Ensuring accessibility

The Tree Grid component's accessibility levels are ensured through an [accessibility-checker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/accessibility-checker) and [axe-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axe-core) software tools during automated testing.

The accessibility compliance of the Tree Grid component is shown in the following sample. Open the [sample](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/accessibility/tree-grid.html) in a new window to evaluate the accessibility of the Tree Grid component with accessibility tools.
