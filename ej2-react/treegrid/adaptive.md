# Adaptive in React TreeGrid

The TreeGrid interface (UI) is optimized for small screens to provide clear viewing and efficient interactions. When adaptive UI is enabled, the component renders filter, sort, and edit dialogs in a full-screen layout and offers an option to render TreeGrid rows horizontally to improve readability on compact layouts.

## Render adaptive dialogs

When the [enableAdaptiveUI](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/treegrid/#enableadaptiveui) property is enabled, the TreeGrid renders filter, sort, and edit dialogs in full screen mode. The following demo demonstrates this behavior.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="app.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/treegrid/adaptive-cs1/app/App.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/treegrid/adaptive-cs1/app/App.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
{% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/treegrid/adaptive-cs1" %}
