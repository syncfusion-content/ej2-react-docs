# Adaptive in React Treegrid component

The Grid user interface (UI) was redesigned to provide an optimal viewing experience and improve usability on small screens. This interface will render the filter, sort, and edit dialogs adaptively and have an option to render the Tree Grid row elements in the horizontal direction.

## Render adaptive dialogs

When you enable the [`enableAdaptiveUI`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/grid/#enableadaptiveui) property, the grid will render the filter, sort, and edit dialogs in full screen for a better user experience. The following demo demonstrates this behaviour.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="app.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/treegrid/adaptive-cs1/app/App.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/treegrid/adaptive-cs1/app/App.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
