# Tool bar in React Treegrid component

The TreeGrid provides ToolBar support to handle treegrid actions. The [`toolbar`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/treegrid/#toolbar) property accepts either the collection of built-in toolbar items and [`ItemModel`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/toolbar/itemModel/)objects for custom toolbar items or HTML element ID for toolbar template.

To use ToolBar, inject **Toolbar** module in the treegrid.
