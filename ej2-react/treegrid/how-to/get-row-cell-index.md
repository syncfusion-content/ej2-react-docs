# Get row cell index in React Treegrid component

You can get the specific row and cell index of the treegrid by using [`rowSelected`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/treegrid/#rowselected) event of the treegrid. Here, we can get the row and cell index by using *aria-rowindex* (get row Index from *tr* element) and *aria-colindex* (column index from *td* element) attribute.
