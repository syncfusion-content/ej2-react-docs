# Select treegrid rows based on certain condition in React Treegrid component

You can select the specific row in the treegrid based on a certain condition by using the [`selectRows`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/treegrid/#selectrows) method in the [`dataBound`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/treegrid/#databound) event of TreeGrid.

In the below demo, we have selected the grid rows only when *Duration* column value greater than *4*.
