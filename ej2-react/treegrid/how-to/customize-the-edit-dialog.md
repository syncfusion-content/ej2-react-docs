# Customize the edit dialog in React Treegrid component

You can customize the appearance of the edit dialog in the [`actionComplete`](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/treegrid/#actioncomplete) event based on **requestType** as **beginEdit** or **add**.

In the below example, we have changed the dialog's header text for editing and adding records.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="app.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/treegrid/customizedialog-cs1/app/App.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/treegrid/customizedialog-cs1/app/App.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="datasource.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/treegrid/customizedialog-cs1/app/datasource.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="datasource.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/treegrid/customizedialog-cs1/app/datasource.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

 {% previewsample "page.domainurl/code-snippet/treegrid/customizedialog-cs1" %}
