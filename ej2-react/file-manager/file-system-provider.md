## SQL database file system provider

In ASP.NET Core, SQL database file system provider allows the users to manage the file system being maintained in a SQL database table. Unlike the other file system providers, the SQL database file system provider works on ID basis. Here, each file and folder have a unique ID based on which all the file operations will be performed. To get started, clone the [sql-server-database-aspcore-file-provider](https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/sql-server-database-aspcore-file-provider) using the following command.

  ```ts

  <add name="FileExplorerConnection" connectionString="Data Source=(LocalDB)\v11.0;AttachDbFilename=|DataDirectory|\FileManager.mdf;Integrated Security=True;Trusted_Connection=true" />

  ```

After cloning, just open the project in Visual Studio and restore the NuGet packages. To establish the SQL server connection with the database file (for eg: FileManager.mdf), specify the connection string in the web config file as follows.

  ```ts

  <add name="FileExplorerConnection" connectionString="Data Source=(LocalDB)\v11.0;AttachDbFilename=|DataDirectory|\FileManager.mdf;Integrated Security=True;Trusted_Connection=true" />

 ```

Then, make an entry for the connection string in `appsettings.json` file as follows.

  ```ts

  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "FileManagerConnection": "Data Source=(LocalDB)\\MSSQLLocalDB;AttachDbFilename=|DataDirectory|\\App_Data\\FileManager.mdf;Integrated Security=True;Connect Timeout=30"
  }

  ```

Now, to configure the database connection, set the connection name, table name and root folder ID value by passing these values to the SetSQLConnection method.

  ```ts
  void SetSQLConnection(string name, string tableName, string tableID)
  ```

> Refer to this [FileManager.mdf](https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/sql-server-database-aspcore-file-provider/blob/master/App_Data/FileManager.mdf), to learn about the pre-defined file system SQL database for the EJ2 File Manager.

After configuring the connection, just build and run the project. Now, the project will be hosted in `http://localhost:{port}` and just mapping the **ajaxSettings** property of the FileManager component to the appropriate controller methods allows to manage the files in the SQL database table.

  {% raw %}

  ```ts

  // Initializing File Manager with SQL Server Database service configuration.
  <div>
    <div className="control-section">
        <FileManagerComponent  id="file"
            ajaxSettings = {{
                // Replace the hosted port number in the place of "{port}"
                url="http://localhost:{port}/api/SQLProvider/SQLFileOperations",
                downloadUrl="http://localhost:{port}/api/SQLProvider/SQLDownload",
                uploadUrl="http://localhost:{port}/api/SQLProvider/SQLUpload",
                getImageUrl="http://localhost:{port}/api/SQLProvider/SQLGetImage"
            }} >
        </FileManagerComponent>
    </div>
  </div>

  ```

## NodeJS file system provider

The NodeJS file system provider allows the users to manage the files and folders in a physical file system. It provides methods for performing all basic file operations like creating a folder, copy, move, delete, and download files and folders in the file system. We can use of the NodeJS file system provider either by installing the [ej2-filemanager-node-filesystem](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@syncfusion/ej2-filemanager-node-filesystem) package or by cloning the [file system provider](https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/ej2-filemanager-node-filesystem) from the GitHub.

### Using ej2-filemanager-node-filesystem package

* Install the ej2-filemanager-node-filesystem package by running the below command.

 ```ts

  npm install @syncfusion/ej2-filemanager-node-filesystem

  ```

* After installing the package, navigate to the ej2-filemanager-node-filesystem package folder within the node-modules
* Run the command **npm install** command.

### Cloning the ej2-filemanager-node-filesystem from GitHub

* Clone the ej2-filemanager-node-filesystem using the following command.

  ```ts

  git clone  https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/ej2-filemanager-node-filesystem.git node-filesystem-provider

  ```

* After cloning, open the root folder and run the command **npm install** command.

After installing the packages, set the root folder directory of the physical file system in the package JSON under scripts sections as follows.

  ```ts

   "start": "node filesystem-server.js -d D:/Projects"

   ```

> **Note:** By default, the root directory will be configured to set `C:/Users` as the root directory.

To set the port in which the project to be hosted and the root directory of the file system. Run the following command.

  ```ts

   set PORT=3000 && node filesystem-server.js -d D:/Projects

   ```

> **Note:** By default, the service will run `8090` port.

Now, just mapping the **ajaxSettings** property of the FileManager component to the appropriate file operation methods in the filesystem-server.js file will allow to manage the physical file system with NodeJS file system provider.

  {% raw %}

  ```ts

  // File Manager sample with nodejs service.
   <div>
    <div className="control-section">

## Google Drive file system provider

In ASP.NET Core, Google Drive file system provider allows the users to manage the files and folders in a Google Drive account. The Google Drive file system provider works on ID basis where each file and folder have a unique ID. To get started,  clone the [google-drive-aspcore-file-provider](https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/google-drive-aspcore-file-provider) using the following command.

  ```ts

   git clone https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/google-drive-aspcore-file-provider  google-drive-aspcore-file-provider

 cd google-drive-aspcore-file-provider

  ```

Google Drive file system provider use the [Google Drive APIs](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/reference/) to read the file in the file system and uses the [OAuth 2.0](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2) protocol for authentication and authorization. To authenticate from the client end, obtain OAuth 2.0 client credentials from the `Google API Console`. To learn more about generating the client credentials from the from Google API Console, refer to this [link](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/javascript-implicit-flow).

After generating the client secret data, copy the JSON data to the following specified JSON files in the cloned location.

  * EJ2GoogleDriveFileProvider > credentials > client_secret.json
  * GoogleOAuth2.0Base > credentials > client_secret.json

After updating the credentials, just build and run the project. Now, the project will be hosted in `http://localhost:{port}`, and it will ask to log on to the Gmail account created the client secret credentials. Then, provide permission to access the Google Drive files by clicking the allow access button in the page. Now, just mapping the **ajaxSettings** property of the FileManager component to the appropriate controller methods will allows to manage the files from the Google Drive.

## Firebase Realtime Database file system provider

The [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/) file system provider in **ASP.NET Core** provides the efficient way to store the File Manager file system in a cloud database as JSON representation.

### Generate Secret access key from service account

Follow the given steps to generate the secret access key:

* To access the Firebase console, please click on this [link](https://console.firebase.google.com/). Once you have accessed the console, you can create a new project by filling in the necessary fields and clicking on the relevant buttons.

![create-project](images/create-project.png)

* Within the Firebase console, navigate to the **Build** tab. Under this tab, select the option for **Realtime Database**. From there, you can create a new database by clicking on the **Create Database** button.

![database-creation](images/database-creation.png)

* To get started, create a root node and add any desired children to it. Please refer to the following code snippet for guidance on the structure of the JSON:

```ts

{
  "Files" : [ {
    "caseSensitive" : false,
    "dateCreated" : "8/22/2019 5:17:55 PM",
    "dateModified" : "8/22/2019 5:17:55 PM",
    "filterId" : "0/",
    "filterPath" : "/",
    "hasChild" : false,
    "id" : "5",
    "isFile" : false,
    "isRoot" : true,
    "name" : "Music",
    "parentId" : "0",
    "selected" : false,
    "showHiddenItems" : false,
    "size" : 0,
    "type" : "folder"
  },
   {
    "caseSensitive" : false,
    "dateCreated" : "8/22/2019 5:18:03 PM",
    "dateModified" : "8/22/2019 5:18:03 PM",
    "filterId" : "0/",
    "filterPath" : "/",
    "hasChild" : false,
    "id" : "6",
    "isFile" : false,
    "isRoot" : true,
    "name" : "videos",
    "parentId" : "0",
    "selected" : false,
    "showHiddenItems" : false,
    "size" : 0,
    "type" : ""
  }]
 }

```

Here, the `Files` denotes the `rootNode` and the subsequent object refers to the children of the root node. `rootNode` will be taken as the root folder of the file system loaded which will be loaded in File Manager component.

* To import a JSON file into the Firebase Realtime Database, navigate to the **Data** tab and click on the action icon shown in the accompanying image. From there, select the **Import JSON** option and upload the JSON file that was created using the code provided above.

![import-json](images/import-json.png)

* To interact with the Firebase Realtime Database through your application, it is necessary to grant read and write permissions by defining appropriate rules in the Firebase project's **Rules tab**, as shown in the following code snippet. Once you have specified the rules, you can publish them by clicking the **Publish** button to enable the necessary authentication.

```ts

{
  /* Visit https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/security to learn more about security rules. */
  "rules": {
    ".read": "auth!=null",
    ".write": "auth!=null"
  }
}

```

> **Note:** By default, rules of a Firebase project will be **false**. To read and write the data, configure the  **Rules** as given in the following code snippet in the *Rules* tab in the Firebase Realtime Database project.

* Navigate to the project settings as instructed and then click on the **Service Account** tab.

![service](images/service.png)

* To obtain the access key JSON file, simply click on the `Generate new private key` button and then confirm by clicking the `Generate key` button in the pop-up window that appears.

![generate_key](images/generate_key.png)

* Next, you will need to clone the [`firebase-realtime-database-apscore-file-provider`](https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/firebase-realtime-database-aspcore-file-provider) repository. Once cloned, simply open the project in Visual Studio and restore the NuGet package.

* Once you have generated the secret key, you will need to replace the JSON in the `access_key.json` file in the Firebase Realtime Database provider project with the newly generated key. This will enable authentication and allow you to perform read and write operations.

* In the **Data** tab, locate the project API URL and then paste it into the below mentioned section.

![api_url](images/api_url.png)

Register the Firebase Realtime Database by assigning *Firebase Realtime Database REST API link*, *rootNode*, and *serviceAccountKeyPath* parameters in the `RegisterFirebaseRealtimeDB` method of class `FirebaseRealtimeDBFileProvider` in the controller part of the ASP.NET Core application.

```ts

this.operation.RegisterFirebaseRealtimeDB(string apiUrl, string rootNode, string serviceAccountKeyPath)

```

**Example:**

```ts

this.operation.RegisterFirebaseRealtimeDB("{copy your API URL here}", "Files", hostingEnvironment.ContentRootPath + \\FirebaseRealtimeDBHelper\\access_key.json);

```

In the above code,

* `{copy your API URL here}` denotes Firebase Realtime Database REST API link.

* `Files` denotes newly created root node in Firebase Realtime  Database.

* `hostingEnvironment.ContentRootPath + \\FirebaseRealtimeDBHelper\\access_key.json` denotes service account key path which has authentication key for the Firebase Realtime Database data.

After configuring the Firebase Realtime Database service link, build and run the project. Now, the project will be hosted in `http://localhost:{port}` and just mapping the **ajaxSettings** property of the File Manager component to the appropriate controller methods allows to manage the files in the Firebase Realtime Database.

```ts
// File Manager sample with IBM COS service.
<div>
    <div className="control-section">
        <FileManagerComponent  id="file"
            ajaxSettings = {{
                // Replace the hosted port number in the place of "{port}"
                url="http://localhost:{port}/api/FirebaseProvider/FirebaseRealtimeFileOperations",
                downloadUrl="http://localhost:{port}/api/FirebaseProvider/FirebaseRealtimeDownload",
                uploadUrl="http://localhost:{port}/api/FirebaseProvider/FirebaseRealtimeUpload",
                getImageUrl="http://localhost:{port}/api/FirebaseProvider/FirebaseRealtimeGetImage"
            }} >
        </FileManagerComponent>
    </div>
</div>

```
{% endraw %}

## IBM Cloud Object Storage file provider

The IBM Cloud Object Storage file provider module allows you work with the IBM Cloud Object Storage. It also provides the methods for performing various file actions such as creating a new folder, renaming files, and deleting files. The IBM Cloud Object Storage file provider serves the file provider support for the File Manager component with the IBM Cloud Object Storage. We can make use of IBM Cloud Object Storage file provider by installing the[ej2-filemanager-ibm-cos-node-file-provider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@syncfusion/ej2-filemanager-ibm-cos-node-file-provider)npm package or by cloning the [file provider](https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/filemanager-ibm-cos-node-file-provider) from the GitHub.

### Using ej2-filemanager-ibm-cos-node-file-provider npm package

* Install the ej2-filemanager-ibm-cos-node-file-provider npm package by running the below command.

   ```ts

   npm install @syncfusion/ej2-filemanager-ibm-cos-node-file-provider

   ```

* After installing the package, navigate to the ej2-filemanager-ibm-cos-node-file-provider package folder within the node-modules.

* Run the  **npm install** command to install the dependent packages for file provider.

### Cloning the filemanager-ibm-cos-node-file-provider from GitHub

* Clone the filemanager-ibm-cos-node-file-provider using the following command.

  ```ts

    git clone  https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/filemanager-ibm-cos-node-file-provider.git

  ```

* After cloning, open the root folder and run the command **npm install** command.

To set the port in which the project to be hosted. Run the following command.

   ```ts

   set PORT=3000 && node index.js

   ```

> **Note:** By default, the service will run `8090` port.

Now, just mapping the **ajaxSettings** property of the FileManager component to the appropriate file operation methods in the index.js file will allow to manage the IBM Cloud Object Storage.
