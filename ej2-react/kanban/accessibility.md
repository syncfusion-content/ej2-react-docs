# Accessibility in React Kanban Component

The Kanban component is designed to meet WAI-ARIA specifications, applying roles, states, and properties to elements like cards (`.e-card`), columns (`.e-header-cells`), and dialogs to ensure accessibility for users relying on assistive technologies (AT) or keyboard navigation. This enables seamless interaction for users with disabilities, such as navigating cards with screen readers or selecting columns via keyboard.

The accessibility compliance for the Kanban component is outlined below.

| Accessibility Criteria | Compatibility |

![Intermediate](images/partial.png)  - Some features of the component do not meet the requirement.

![No](images/not-supported.png)  - The component does not meet the requirement.

## WAI-ARIA attributes

The Kanban component followed the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/alert/) patterns to meet the accessibility. The following ARIA attributes are used in the Kanban component:

| Attributes | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `aria-label` |  It helps to provides information about elements in a kanban component for assistive technology. |
| `aria-expanded` | Attributes indicate the state of a collapsible element. |
| `aria-selected` | This attribute is assigned to the Kanban component for the selection of elements, and its default value is `false`. The value changes to true when the user selects a Kanban card. |
| `aria-grabbed` | Indicates whether the attribute is set to true. It has been selected for dragging. If this attribute is set to false, the element can be grabbed for a drag-and-drop operation but will not be currently grabbed. |
| `aria-describedby` | This attribute contains the ID of the Kanban header column to indicate that the attribute establishes an association between the Kanban header column and the Kanban column body. |
| `aria-roledescription` | This attribute is assigned to the Kanban component and is used to provide alternative descriptions for card elements. |

## Keyboard interaction

The Kanban component supports the [keyboard interaction](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/alert/#keyboardinteraction) guideline, making it easy for people who use assistive technologies (AT) and those who completely rely on keyboard navigation. The following keyboard shortcuts are supported by the Kanban component.
