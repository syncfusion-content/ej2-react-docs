      HyperText Markup Language, commonly referred to as HTML, is the standard markup
      language used to create web pages. Along with CSS, and JavaScript, HTML is a cornerstone
      technology, used by most websites to create visually engaging web pages, user interfaces
      for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications. Web browsers
      can read HTML files and render them into visible or audible web pages. HTML describes
      the structure of a website semantically along with cues for presentation, making it a
      markup language, rather than a programming language.
