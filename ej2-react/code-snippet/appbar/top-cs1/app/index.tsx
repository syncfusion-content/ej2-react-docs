          The AppBar component supports built-in themes such as Material, Bootstrap, Fabric (Office 365), Tailwind CSS, and high contrast. Users can customize these built-in themes or create new themes to achieve their desired look and feel by either simply overriding SASS variables or using our Theme Studio application.
