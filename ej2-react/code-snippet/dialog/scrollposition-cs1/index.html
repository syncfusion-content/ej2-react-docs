            <b>JavaScript:</b><br /> JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language.
            It has been standardized in the ECMAScript language specification. Alongside HTML and CSS, it is one of the three
            essential technologies of World Wide Web content production; the majority of websites employ it and it is supported
            by all modern Web browsers without plug-ins. JavaScript is prototype-based with first-class functions, making
            it a multi-paradigm language, supporting object - oriented , imperative, and functional programming styles.
            <br /><br /><br />
            <b>MVC:</b><br /> Model–view–controller (MVC) is a software architecture pattern which separates the representation
            of information from the user's interaction with it. The model consists of application data, business rules, logic,
            and functions. A view can be any output representation of data, such as a chart or a diagram. Multiple views
            of the same data are possible, such as a bar chart for management and a tabular view for accountants. The controller
            mediates input, converting it to commands for the model or view.The central ideas behind MVC are code reusability
            and in addition to dividing the application into three kinds of components, the MVC design defines the interactions
            between them. A controller can send commands to its associated view to change the view's presentation of the
            model (e.g., by scrolling through a document). It can also send commands to the model to update the model's state
            (e.g., editing a document). A model notifies its associated views and controllers when there has been a change
            in its state. This notification allows the views to produce updated output, and the controllers to change the
            available set of commands. A passive implementation of MVC omits these notifications, because the application
            does not require them or the software platform does not support them. A view requests from the model the information
            that it needs to generate an output representation to the user.
