# Index in React Tooltip component

The **Tooltip** component displays a pop-up containing an information or a message when you hover, click, focus, or touch an element.
The information displayed in the Tooltip can include simple text, images, hyperlinks, or custom templates. In mobile devices, to display the Tooltip, you need to tap and hold the target elements.

## Key features

Tooltip
* Can be displayed in 12 different positions.
* Supports animation effects while showing/hiding the Tooltip.
* Content can be assigned with static text, template, or loaded dynamically via AJAX.
* Supports 4 opening modes, `hover`, `click`, `focus`, and `custom`.
* Supports auto tip positioning.
* Can be moved along with the mouse pointer using the mouse trailing option.
