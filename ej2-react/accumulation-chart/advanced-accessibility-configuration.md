# Accessibility customization

The SyncfusionÂ® React Accumulation Chart control is structured to visualize data in a graphical manner. It provides robust customization options for accessibility, allowing you to enhance the user experience for those with disabilities. The main attributes of the React Accumulation Chart control's accessibility customization are briefly explained in this section.

The accumulation chart control has a number of characteristics that enable accessibility features to be customized, including:

* `accessibilityDescription` - Provides a text description for the accumulation chart, improving support for screen readers.
* `accessibilityRole` - Specifies the role of the accumulation chart, helping screen readers to identify the element appropriately.
* `focusable` - Allows the accumulation chart to receive focus, making it accessible via keyboard navigation.
* `focusBorderColor` - Sets the color of the focus border, enhancing visibility when the accumulation chart is focused.
* `focusBorderMargin` - Defines the margin around the focus border.
* `focusBorderWidth` - Specifies the width of the focus border.
* `tabIndex` - Specifies the tab order for the accumulation chart element, enabling efficient keyboard navigation.
