# Getting Started with Agentic UI Builder

The **Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> React UI Builder** uses AI to help you build React applications with natural language commands. Simply describe what you want to create, and it generates complete UI implementations with Syncfusion components.

## Installation

Follow the [Installation Guide](../installation) to set up the MCP server in your development environment.

## Usage

Once installed, open your AI assistant in the IDE and describe what you want to build with the `#sf_react_ui_builder` command:

```
#sf_react_ui_builder Create a dashboard with a sales data grid and monthly trend chart.
```

The UI Builder generates complete implementations including layout, components, and styling.

> Note: Using the `#sf_react_ui_builder` tool ensures the Agentic UI Builder is invoked directly. Alternatively, you can use natural language without the tool—just make sure to include the "Syncfusion" keyword in your prompt so the AI model can automatically recognize and call the appropriate generator.

## Individual Tools

For targeted assistance, you can call individual tools directly using their specific tool names. This is useful when you need specialized help from a particular tool.

### Layout Tool (`#sf_react_layout`)

Provides a catalog of pre-built, responsive UI layout templates and blocks for common page sections and design patterns.

**When to use:** Page structures, responsive layouts, or pre-built UI patterns.

**Example:**
```
#sf_react_layout Create a responsive card layout for product listings.
```

### Component Tool (`#sf_react_component`)

Provides quick reference guidelines for Syncfusion React components, including properties, event handlers, methods, and usage examples.

**When to use:** To get basic component API information and structure details for implementing specific components correctly.

**Example:**
```
#sf_react_component How do I integrate a data table?
```

### Style Tool (`#sf_react_style`)

Provides theme configuration, styling setup, and icon integration for Syncfusion React components. Supports multiple themes (Tailwind3 CSS, Bootstrap 5.3, Material 3, Fluent 2), light/dark mode implementation, and icon patterns for consistent UI styling.

**When to use:** To apply themes, customize colors, modify the visual design of components, or integrate icons into your UI.

**Example:**
```
#sf_react_style How do I apply the Syncfusion Tailwind 3 dark theme and add a communication icon inside a button?
```

## Best Practices

To maximize the effectiveness of the Agentic UI Builder and achieve optimal results:

- **Minimize active tools:** Limit the number of active MCP tools in your IDE to prevent tool-selection ambiguity and improve response accuracy.
- **Start simple:** Begin with straightforward prompts and progressively add complexity as needed.
- **Be specific:** Provide clear, specific descriptions of your layout requirements, component behavior, and design preferences.
- **Reference patterns:** Mention existing design systems, component libraries, or specific patterns you want to replicate.
- **Stay consistent:** Maintain consistent file organization, naming conventions, and coding standards throughout your React project.
- **Work incrementally:** For better control and precision—break down complex layouts into individual sections rather than requesting multiple blocks simultaneously.
- **Use advanced AI models:** For best results, use **Claude Sonnet 4.5 or higher** models. Other compatible models include **GPT-5 and Gemini 3 Pro**. Higher-capability models produce better code quality and more accurate component implementations.

> Always review AI-generated code before using it in production.
